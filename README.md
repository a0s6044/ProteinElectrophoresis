# ProteinElectrophoresis
Algorithms and figures used to analyse protein electrophoresis curves

The algorithms were trained and run under the following environment and libraries:
Python 3.8.10, gcc 9.4.0, keras 2.6.0, open_cv 4.5.4, pyforest 1.1.0. Pandas 1.0.5 with Matplotlib 3.4.3 was used for data upload and processing. All decision trees were also based on this same version of the sklearn library. Feature importance was based on the Shapely values from the Shapely 1.7.1 library.
